            <p><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> (born June 8, 1955, <em>London</em>, England) is a <em>British</em>
            <em>computer scientist</em>, generally <em>credited</em> as the <em>inventor</em> of the <em>World Wide Web</em>. 
            In 2004, he was awarded a knighthood by Queen <em>Elizabeth</em> II of the <em>United Kingdom</em> and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.

            <br>
            <p>Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the <em>Ferranti Mark I</em>, 
            the first commercial computer. (See <em>computer: The first stored-program machines</em>.) 
            After graduating in 1976 from the <em>University of Oxford</em>, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., 
            located in <em>Poole</em>, Dorset, <em>England</em>. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry,
            including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at <em>CERN</em>, the European <em>particle physics</em> laboratory in <em>Geneva</em>.
